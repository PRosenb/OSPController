# OSP Controller ☀️🕹

_DC -> DC -> DC_ Solar. With a single used solar panel, a few used batteries, and $40 in parts you can power your life, transportation and all. Add an ESP32 Arduino to a 95% efficient DC-DC buck converter controlled over serial and you get an internet-connected, privately hosted smart solar MPPT power system.
