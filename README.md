# Free The Sun! ☀️

I want to enable everyone in the world to _run their own transportation_ all from solar power with smaller, smarter, and more extensible solar power systems.. And so here you have it. 

### This solar controller:
- Costs less than $35 in total parts
- Works with 12 - 82VDC Solar Panels, _(enabling big and efficient strings of panels!)_
- Works with 4.2 - 60VDC batteries. Directly charge your high-voltage eBike batteries!
- Is open source, modify it as you wish!
- Connects to your MQTT smart home
- Lets you own your own data
- Gives you graphs and charts about your system from anywhere
