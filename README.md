# OSP Controller ‚òÄÔ∏èüïπ

I want to enable everyone in the world to _run their own transportation_ all from solar power with smaller, smarter, and more extensible solar power systems.. And so here you have it. 

[The wiki](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki) is where I've got your up-to-date [how-to](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki), [parts list](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki/Step-1%3A-Parts-List), [about](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki/About), etc.

### This solar controller:
- Costs less than $35 in [total parts](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki/Step-1%3A-Parts-List)
- Works with 12 - 82VDC Solar Panels, _(enabling big and efficient strings of panels!)_
- Works with 4.2 - 60VDC batteries. Directly charge your high-voltage eBike batteries!
- Is open source, modify it as you wish!
- Connects to your MQTT smart home
- Lets you own your own data
- Gives you [graphs and charts](https://github.com/opensolarproject/OSPController/wiki/Step-4:-Data-Visualization) about your system from anywhere
